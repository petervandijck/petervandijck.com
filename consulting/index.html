<h2>What clients say.</h2>
<p>Marina Tognetti: &quot;Peter did a great job with the interaction design of our start-up. He  very quickly grasped the concept, forced us to set priorities, produced  immediate results.&quot;</p>
<p>Javier Velasco: &quot;Peter has  been instrumental to the  development of the field, especially as a pusher towards  internationalization.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Bilman: &quot;Peter is by far the best Information Architect I have ever worked with.  His quick understanding of a concept, ability to sketch it out and  communicate ideas in broad strokes as well as his minute attention to detail makes him  one of my favorite people to work with. I highly reccommend Peter to  anyone looking for world class consumer experience help.&quot;</p>
