      <h1>eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language.</h1>
      <p>XFML Core is an open XML format for publishing and sharing hierarchical 
        faceted metadata and indexing efforts. XFML Core is lightweight and easy 
        to implement, yet uniquely powerful.</p>
      <p><a href="spec/1.0.html">The XFML 1.0 spec is here. </a></p>
      <p><strong>A 2007 note for researchers</strong>: my take on XFML now is this: it was an interesting experiment, a so-so spec (not great, not bad either), but I now don't think there's demand for a format to exchange faceted data, and it hasn't been used much. It was fun though. </p>
      <h2>Announcements</h2>
      <h3>August 2007. Moved spec. </h3>
      <p>I lost the xfml.org domain, it got squatted, so I moved the spec to http://petervandijck.com/xfml/, which will continue to be its home in the foreseeable future. </p>
      <h3>February 14, 2003 Clarifications to XFML Core spec.</h3>
      <p>Added a few <a href="/spec/1.0.html#revisions">revisions</a> to XFML 
        Core. Clarifications only - the spec hasn't changed.</p>
      <h3>December 13, 2002 Revisions to XFML Core spec to remove minor inconsistencies 
        with examples.</h3>
      <p>Added <a href="/spec/1.0.html#revisions">two revisions</a> to XFML Core. 
        Clarifications only - the spec hasn't changed.</p>
      <h3>October 08, 2002 XFML Core.</h3>
      <p>Today the XFML Core (aka XFML version 1.0) spec is officially published 
        at <a href="http://purl.oclc.org/NET/xfml/core/">http://purl.oclc.org/NET/xfml/core/</a>. 
        XFML Core is an XML language for sharing hierarchical faceted metadata 
        and indexing efforts. XFML Core is a stable and frozen spec, and is permanently 
        licensed to the public. XFML won&#146;t solve all your metadata problems 
        &#150; it is focused on sharing indexing efforts with faceted metadata. 
      </p>
      <p>XFML was designed for power and simplicity. Coding an XFML export is 
        often as easy as writing a template. Here is an XFML template for Moveabletype: 
        <a href="http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/000494.html">http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/000494.html</a> 
        Drupal (<a href="http://drupal.org">http://drupal.org</a>) has an XFML 
        export module. Livetopics (<a href="http://www.novissio.com/products/liveTopics/liveTopics.html">http://www.novissio.com/products/liveTopics/liveTopics.html</a>), 
        a tool to add topical metadata to Radio Userland, also exports XFML: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107808/2002/10/07.html#a458">http://radio.weblogs.com/0107808/2002/10/07.html#a458</a> 
      </p>
      <p>Once you publish your metadata as XFML, you can share it, and use it 
        in other applications. Facetmap, an application to browse faceted metadata, 
        was the first application to import XFML: <a href="http://facetmap.com">http://facetmap.com</a>. 
        For example, you can export Livetopics as XFML and import it in Facetmap 
        as in this example: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107808/2002/10/07.html#a457">http://radio.weblogs.com/0107808/2002/10/07.html#a457</a> 
        Bpallen Technologies is also working on XFML support for their Teapot 
        product: <a href="http://bpallen.com">http://bpallen.com</a>. </p>
      <p>The real power of XFML lies in the concept of directly connecting topics. 
        This allows authors to reuse existing indexing efforts. Metadata authoring 
        applications that take advantage of this concept are being developed.</p>
      <p>XFML Core was developed by Peter Van Dijck (<a href="http://petervandijck.net">http://petervandijck.net</a>), 
        with crucial support and feedback from Matt Mower, Travis Wilson, Eric 
        Scheid, Danny Ayers, David Gammel, Leonard Will, Louis Argerich and many 
        more.</p>
      <h3>July 06, 2002 XFML 0.2 released.</h3>
      <p>Version 0.2 of XFML is published today. <br>
        XFML is an XML format that lets you publish your metadata categories on 
        the web in a standard format, and connect your metadata with metadata 
        other people have published. This means you can automatically generated 
        links to related content on your own and other websites.<br>
        Evolution of the language.</p>
      <p>XFML version 0.2 introduces a number of refinements compard with version 
        0.1, most notably elements, which allow software to easily display singular 
        or plural versions of topics, facets and occurrence types. (note - this 
        was removed in the final spec.) The main outstanding issue currently being 
        discussed is whether topics should be allowed to have multiple parents. 
        It would mean more power, but we want to avoid increased complexity of 
        implementation of XFML in a content management system. XFML is being designed 
        so implementation of it in a content management system can be completed 
        in, say, a weekend or two.</p>
      <p>Compatibility with topic maps (XTM) and RDF.<br>
        XFML is being designed as a subset of the topicmap standard (<a href="http://topicmaps.org">http://topicmaps.org</a>), 
        optimized for a specific goal (sharing and connection faceted metadata 
        between websites). Topic maps were designed so languages like this would 
        be easy to define. XFML will be compatible with topicmaps in that any 
        XFML file can be transformed into valid XTM easily. Work is also being 
        done on RDF serialization of XFML, which will mean compatibility between 
        XFML and RDF. This means that XFML authors will be able to use existing 
      RDF and XTM tools.</p>
      <h3>May 30, 2002 XFML 0.1 published.</h3>
      <p>XFML version 0.1 is published by Peter Van Dijck (<a href="mailto:peter@poorbuthappy.com">peter@poorbuthappy.com</a>) 
        at <a href="http://xfml.org">http://xfml.org</a>. XFML is an open XML 
        format for publishing and connecting faceted metadata between websites. 
        It is based on topicmaps (<a href="http://topicmaps.org">http://topicmaps.org</a>), 
        and aims to achieve the ease of use of RSS.<br>
